# ODE (Orthographic Dynamic Execution)

Orthographic = the way something is written

The plan is to compile to musl libc.

This is a learning project that I will be slowly revisiting whenever I have inspiration to do so.

Do not expect this to be the next big thing.

But the plan is to make something safe, low level, exceedingly flexible, and with actors, so its quite the task.

However I also have an interesting idea about types that I am still trying to find the shape of.

So I hold to none of the ideas stated above strongly and reserve the right to change my mind at any time.

Also, its currently just an ornate calculator... it will get there...
